`ipld` is a recursion schemes library for operating on hash-linked data structures such as those found in VCSs (e.g. Git, Darcs, Mercurial, etc.), blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc), and distributed stores (e.g. IPFS, Riak, etc.).

At present the main purpose of `ipld` is as a platform for research in Merkle graph specification, construction, and interop, in particular research into compiling DAG-based expressions such as [legit](https://morr.cc/legit/), [IPLD selectors](https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/master/selectors/selectors.md), or [Merklized ASTs](http://www.mit.edu/~jlrubin/public/pdfs/858report.pdf).
